KNN-ML
K-Nearest Neighbors Implementation and Analysis
This repository demonstrates the implementation of the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm in Python. The project includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

### Key Features
- Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, feature scaling, and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
- Model Implementation: Building the KNN model using the scikit-learn library.
- Model Evaluation: Assessing the performance of the KNN model using various metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Visualization: Visualizing the results using plots to better understand the model's performance.
