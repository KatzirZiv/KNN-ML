Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm in Python. KNN is a simple, supervised machine learning algorithm that can be used for classification and regression tasks. This repository contains a detailed exploration of KNN, including data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

Features
Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, feature scaling, and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
Model Implementation: Building the KNN model using the scikit-learn library.
Model Evaluation: Assessing the performance of the KNN model using various metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Visualization: Visualizing the results using plots to better understand the model's performance.
